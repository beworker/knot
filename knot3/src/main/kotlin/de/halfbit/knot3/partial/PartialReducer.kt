/**
 * Partial reducer is useful when the same change (or its payload) needs to be
 * shared among multiple reducers. Such reducers should then implement the
 * `PartialReducer` interface and the main reducer, which initially receives the
 * change, should dispatch it (or its payload) to all partial reducers. Each
 * partial reducer should return a new state back, which will then be provided
 * to the next reducer in the list and so on until all partial reducers are
 * processed. The resulting state can be returned back from the main reducer to
 * knot.
 *
 * Use [dispatch] extension function for dispatching the payload to partial
 * reducers.
