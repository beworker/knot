/**
 * Partial reducer is useful when the same change (or its payload data) needs to
 * be reduced by multiple reducers. The reducers should then implement `PartialReducer`
 * interface and the main reducer, which receives the change, should dispatch it
 * (or its payload data) to all partial reducers. Each partial reducer should return
 * a new state back, which will be then provided to the next reducer in the list and
 * so on, until all partial reducers are processed. The resulting state should be
 * returned back from the main reducer.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val reducers: List<PartialReducer<State, Playback, Action>>
 *
 * knot<State, Change, Action> {
 *   state {
 *     initial = State("initial")
 *   }
 *   changes {
 *     reduce { change ->
 *       reducers.reduce(this, change.payload)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For example, when a media player dispatches playback data and it needs to be
 * distributed to multiple primes, then the primes should also implement `PartialReducer`
 * interfaces and the main prime responsible for receiving playback data should provide
 * it to all those partial reducers.
