/**
 * If your [Knot] becomes big and you want to improve its redability and maintainability, you may consider
 * to decompose it. You start decomposition by grouping related functionality into, in a certain sense,
 * indecomposable pieces called `Primes`.
 *
 * [Flowchart diagram](https://github.com/beworker/knot/raw/master/docs/diagrams/flowchart-composite-knot.png)
 *
 * Each `Prime` is isolated from the other `Primes`. It defines its own set of `Changes`, `Actions` and
 * `Reducers`. It's only the `State`, what is shared between the `Primes`. In that respect each `Prime` can
 * be seen as a separate [Knot] working on a shared `State`.
 *
 * Once all `Primes` are registered at a `CompositeKnot`, the knot can be finally composed using
 * [compose] function and start operating.
